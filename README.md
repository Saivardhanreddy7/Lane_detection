# 🛣️ Lane Detection using OpenCV and NumPy

This project implements a **Lane Detection System** using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.  
It detects lane lines on roads from both images and videos by applying several computer vision techniques including **color filtering**, **edge detection**, **region masking**, and **Hough line transforms**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detects **lane lines** in both images and videos  
- Uses **Canny edge detection** and **Hough line transform**  
- Filters **yellow and white** lane markings  
- Draws smooth lane lines over the original frame  
- Adjustable parameters for tuning accuracy

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **MoviePy**
